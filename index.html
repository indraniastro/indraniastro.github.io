								<p>My research interests focus on <strong>star and planet formation</strong>, with a particular emphasis on the  <strong>earliest stages of star formation and the evolution of a protoplanetary disk aroung the young protostar</strong>.
								I perform detailed nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of core collapse to understand the <strong>role of gravity, magnetic fields, and thermal pressure in the formation of protostars (pre-main sequence stars)</strong>. 
								In addition, I also study <strong>long-term evolution of gas-dust magnetized protoplanetary disks</strong> to understand the accretion mechanisms of young stars—such as <strong>episodic outbursts—and the growth of dust grains</strong>. 
								These processes are central to the formation of first-generation planetesimals, the <strong>building blocks of planets</strong>.
								I also study how molecular clouds undergo <strong>magnetized gravitational fragmentation</strong> to form dense prestellar cores—the birthsites of star formation. 
								My aim is to connect observations and theory of star-disk systems by exploring the underlying physics through theoretical and numerical modeling.

								    <h3>1. How Does a Protostar Form though Magnetized Gravitaional Collapse?</h3>
								    <p>
								      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...982..193D/abstract" target="_blank">
								        Das, Shang, & Krasnopolsky, ApJ, 2025
								      </a>
								      <br> The enigma of star formation in galaxies continues to captivate astronomers around the world, with a fundamental question remaining: how do self-gravity, magnetic fields, and thermal pressure play a role in protostar formation? 
									Our work reveals a constraint on the degree of non-isothermality in the choice of Equation of states (EOSs), that says a polytropic monoatomic index of Γ no stiffer than 4/3, complemented by the magnetized virial theorem, 
									    ensures sufficient cooling in allowing a protostar to form and grow continuously through the magnetized gravitational collapse of interstellar molecular gas clouds. The global MHD collapse models with a Γ softer than or equal to 4/3, 
									    the infall dynamics qualitatively follow the behaviour of the isothermal case. However, for the model collapse with a Γ harder than 4/3, 
									    causes a reduction in the mass accretion rate into the central (point-mass like) protostar, thus delaying the collapse. 
									     At the scales of protostar’s surface, which is likely several solar radii, the heating from the
										accumulated material within may begin to significantly 
										influence the EOS by transitioning to the regime of
										nonisothermality. However, this regime of nonisothermality
										may remain confined to within the protostar’s surface only,
										similar to the case of a chromosphere, and certainly does not
										impede the mass infall during collapse.

								    <h3>2. Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks and Prospects of Planetesimal Formation</h3>
								    <p>
								      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...983..163D/abstract" target="_blank">
								        Das, Vorobyov, & Basu, ApJ, 2025
								      </a>
								      <br>In this work, we investigated We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation 
									    in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk (PPD) with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), 
									    particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a comparison to its low-mass cousins. 
									    Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability. 
									    These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. 
									    In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and a more extended inner dead zone, 
									    both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for the SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. 
									    Our results suggest that disks around YIMSs may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. 
									    This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with <i>M</i><sub>★</sub> &gt; 3<i>M</i><sub>⊙</sub>.

								    <h3>3. Variation of the Core Lifetime and Fragmentation Scale in Molecular Clouds as an Indication of Ambipolar Diffusion</h3>
								    <p> 
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649L..13D/abstract/" target="_blank">
								        Das, Basu, & André, A&A Letters, 2021 <br>
								      </a>
								      Fragmentation in large molecular clouds probed by SMA, ALMA, VLA, JCMT, and <em>Herschel</em> has been of great interest in recent years. 
								    In this work, we apply the magnetically (nonideal MHD) modulated threshold for fragmentation scale (length scale, time scale, and mass) to fit the data of the evolutionary time/lifetime and fragmentation mass of prestellar cores identified with Herschel Space Observatory in the Aquila cloud 
								    as well as the number of enclosed cores formed in a parent clump measured in Perseus cloud complex with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). 
								    By varying a single parameter, the normalized mass-to-flux ratio (lying in the range 1 &#8804; μ  &#8804; 2), over the range of observationally measured densities, 
								    we fit the range of prestellar core lifetimes that varies from 0.1 to a few Myr. 
								    Moreover, we found the estimated lifetime is few times the free-fall toward the low density regime and essentially merges with the free-fall time toward the higher end of density.
								    This cannot be explained in a purely hydrodynamic scenario.

								<!--<p><strong>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF STAR FORMATION</strong></p>
								<p>I wrote this (very) brief overview of the history of star formation for the introduction of <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/8728/" target="_blank">my PhD thesis</a>. Those interested in the history of science might find it interesting.</p>
								You may check out my work on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace6/meta" target="_blank">"How Does a Protostar Form thorugh Magnetized Gravitational Collapse?</a> that may answer the longstanding big question in star formation studies: what stops the mass infall on to a protostar?</p>
