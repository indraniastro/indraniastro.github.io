								<p>Hello! I appreciate your time in getting to know me. I am <strong>Indrani</strong>, currently a <a href="https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=idas" target="_blank"><strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong></a> at the <strong>Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA)</strong> in Taipei, Taiwan. My roots lie in Calcutta, India. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Calcutta and went on to complete my Master's degree in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP), in India. Afterward, I moved to Canada to pursue my Ph.D. in Astrophysics at the University of Western Ontario under the supervision of Dr. Shantanu Basu.</p> 
								<p>My research interests span broadly in theoretical and computational astrophysics, and aim specifically to understand how stars form out of their natal molecular clouds. My work focuses on the major open problems of star formation physics, including rapid inside-out gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores followed by the formation of a protoplanetary disk and an optically thick infalling envelope, and the crucial role of the magnetic field in making it happen. I am equally passionate about public outreach, aiming to inspire and engage young minds in learning about the dynamics of the magnetized Universe. If you're interested, you can check out <a href="#research">my research here</a>.</p>
								<p>When I'm not immersed in simulating stars and planets, you'll likely find me on the badminton court, embarking on hikes, or exploring the diverse world of cuisines.</p>

								<p>My main focus in research revolves around addressing the fundamental key questions on the star and planet formation, through the utilization of cutting-edge magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, semi-analytical modelling.</p>
								<p>I perform detailed nonideal MHD simulations of core collapse to understand the role of gravity, thermal pressure, and magnetic fields in the formation of protostars (pre-main sequence star). In addition, I also study long-term evolution of gas-dust magnetized protoplanetary disks to understand the accretion mechanisms of young stars, for example, the phenomena of episodic accretion outbursts, and the evolution of dust dynamics within disks. This is the key to understand how first-generation planetesimals form in these disks, which are the building blocks of planets. Furthermore, I am also interested in studying the gravitational magnetized fragmentation of the molecular clouds and how they form dense cores, which are often considered as the prestellar cores, the prerequisites for star formation. The numerical and theoretical modelling allow us to delve deeper into the underlying physics and to better understand the direct observations of star-disk systems in our magnetized universe.</p>

								<p><strong>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF STAR FORMATION</strong></p>
								<p>I wrote this (very) brief overview of the history of star formation for the introduction of <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/8728/" target="_blank">my PhD thesis</a>. Those interested in the history of science might find it interesting.</p>
								You may check out my work on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace6/meta" target="_blank">"How Does a Protostar Form thorugh Magnetized Gravitational Collapse?</a> that may answer the longstanding big question in star formation studies: what stops the mass infall on to a protostar?</p>
